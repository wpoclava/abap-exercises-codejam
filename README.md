# CodeJam - SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment & ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/abap-exercises-codejam)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/abap-exercises-codejam)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment & ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. Prerequisites and recommendations for this CodeJam are documented in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### CodeJam overview

This CodeJam introduces attendees to the SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment, aka Steampunk and the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model. Developers can leverage the unmanaged scenario for extending existing applications and consuming existing ABAP resources. For brand new applications, developers can leverage the managed senario for building their application from the ground up.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. Each exercise is meant to be independent of each other so, attendees can potential pick and choose which exercise to work on.  Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

<!---### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).
