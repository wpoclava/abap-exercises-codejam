# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will connect to the system and create your package. Be sure to use your assigned group number anywhere you see XXX in this document. 

## System Access & Package Creation

After completing these steps you will have accessed your trial account on SAP Cloud Platform, created a service instance for the ABAP Trial on SCP, created a connection to the system from ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse, and finally created your group package which will be used for the rest of your exercise.
